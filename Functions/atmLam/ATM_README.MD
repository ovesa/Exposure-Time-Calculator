All of the Sky tables are uploaded.
The numbers correspond to the Sun-Moon separation angle
0 = New Moon (NM)
45 = Waxing Crescent (WxC)
90 = First Quarter (FQ)
135 = Waxing Gibbous (WxG)
180 =Full Moon (FM)
225 = Waning Gibbous (WnG)
270 = Third Quarter (TQ)
315 = Waning Crescent (WnC)
With these, the background photon flux needs to be calculated.
