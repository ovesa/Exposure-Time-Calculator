Main Function: S = calcPhotFlux(mag_sys,band,mag)
Description: This function takes in a magnitude and converts it into photon flux.
Inputs: magnitude system ("AB" or "Vega"),
band ("AB"-"u","g","r","i","z"; "Vega"-"U","B","V","R","I","J","H","K"), 
and magnitude (e.g. 15)

Outputs: S (Photon Flux) [photons/cm^2/s/um]

Sub functions: 
Flam, lam = ABFlux(band,mag) # convert AB mag to flux
Flam, lam = VegaFlux(band,mag) # convert Vega mag to flux
